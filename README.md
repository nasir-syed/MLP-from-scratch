# MLP-from-scratch
The task was to create a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model from scratch for the optical recognition of handwritten digits datasets from the University of California at Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.

The MLP model uses the RMSProp optimizer, along with dropout regularization and Kaiming He initialization. It achieves an accuracy of ~ 98.5%
